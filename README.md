# 🐍 My First Python Project

This is my very first Python project, created as part of my learning journey using PyCharm and GitHub.

### 📄 Project Description:
This project is a simple command-line Python program that simulates a phone book.  
It allows users to enter a phone number and returns the owner's name if the number exists in the dictionary.

### ✅ Features:
- Validates if the phone number is exactly 10 digits
- Checks if the number exists in a predefined dictionary
- Displays error messages for invalid or unknown numbers

### ▶ How to Run:
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the file using the command:
   ```bash
   python phonebook.py
